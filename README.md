# Using K-Means clustering, high-demand areas were identified to strategically pre-allocate MRS resources, minimizing response times and enhancing emergency medical service efficiency.
🔍 Unlocking Faster Emergency Response with Machine Learning 📈
1. What we achieved: 🏍 Strategic Resource Allocation: Using K-Means clustering, we pinpointed key high-demand zones, allowing us to pre-position MRS units effectively.
2. 🕒 20% Faster Response: Average response time dropped from 5.154 to 4.093 minutes, marking a major improvement in critical scenarios.
3. 📊 Consistent Response Performance: By decreasing the standard deviation from 6.208 to 4.265, our approach led to greater predictability in EMS timing.
